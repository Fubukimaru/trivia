A really silly Hanoi Towers program.
There are two modes: Play or recursive resolution.

Play:
It waits two integers, the origin and destination of the movement.
For example, if you enter "1 3", the top piece of the first tower will move to the third.
To exit: control+c or whatever command your OS uses to kill a process :)... OR FINISH IT!

Recursive resolution:
Set the speed and enjoy.


To compile: g++ hanoi.cpp -o hanoi
