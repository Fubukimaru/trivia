A really silly Hanoi Towers program.
It waits two integers, the origin and destination of the movement.

For example, if you enter "1 3", the top piece of the first tower will move to the third.

To exit: control+c or whatever command your OS uses to kill a process :).


To compile: g++ hanoi.cpp -o hanoi
